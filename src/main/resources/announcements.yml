    # If your server version is lower than 1.16, then the legacy color code is recommended.
    # Although the plugin is color compatible with a lower version (it will automatically replace
    # the RGB color with the closest legacy color), we still do not recommend using RGB color code
    # if the server version is lower than 1.16.
