    # If you enabled config 'Console-broadCast', placeholder will directly display ITS RAW TEXT
    # (if this placeholder must be parsed with a player.)
    #
    # If your server version is lower than 1.16, then the legacy color code is recommended.
    # Although the plugin is color compatible with a lower version (it will automatically replace
    # the RGB color with the closest legacy color), we still do not recommend using RGB color code
    # if the server version is lower than 1.16.
